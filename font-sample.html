    <p class="title">Quaroutine Baking</p>
    <p class="heading">Homemade 'Tillas</p>
    <p class="body">1 cup whole wheat flour (I use pastry)</p>
    <p class="body">1 cup all-purpose flour</p>
    <p class="body">Generous pinch of sea salt</p>
    <p class="body">4 tablespoons melted coconut oil</p>
    <p class="body"> ¾ cup hot water</p>

    <p class="body">Mix the flours and salt in a large bowl. Add the melted coconut oil, incorporating with a fork until the mixture is nice and crumbly. Lumpy = good.</p>

    <p class="body">Add the hot water, mixing until the dough comes together. Knead for a few minutes, then cover and let rest for about 20 minutes.</p>

    <p class="body">Once the dough has rested, I like to drag little lines across the top to divide it into eight rough sections of dough. Eyeballing is fine. With your fork, scoop out one section of dough out at a time and then roll it out thinly and evenly into a circle. The dough should appear somewhat translucent when you pick it up to transfer to your pan.</p>

    <p class="body">Pre-heat your skillet over medium-high heat, and cook your tortillas one at a time. You should see some beautiful, bubbly brown spots start to form, which lets you know it’s ready for a flip. Typically this will be about 30-60 seconds on each side.</p>

    <p class="body">Eat immediately! If you’re cooking up a large batch, keep them warm in the oven, set to its lowest temperature. If you have leftovers, you can store in the fridge for a few days, reheating over the stove or in a toaster over with a misting of water to get a nice steamed effect.</p>
